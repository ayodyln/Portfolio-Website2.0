Utalizing files that contained Star Wars asset information such as characters, vehicles, and planets. To access that information, we learned the basics of looping through arrays and objects, and then populating the DOM. I felt I was successful in the goal for this assignment, so I took the time to learn a bit of mobile responsiveness before it was taught to me. This helped introduce me to the world of responsive design and I did fail at it for this assignment, but its a foundation I got that set me up for success. On top of that, this was also exploration of creativity and trying to make this site my own, so I explored color themes and simple creative ways to make it unique, which gave me a introduction of designing a website with just code.`,

Using vanilla Javascript and the fetch API I learned how to grab data from an external server and populate a webpage via this method. Outcome of this project was knowledge of what APIs are, how to work with them, and other modern Javascript methods.`,
