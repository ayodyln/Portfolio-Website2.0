                    <!-- Why you chose your topic. -->
                    <p>
                        I'm a huge fan of snowboarding and mountain sports in general. Whenever I'm in the mountains I
                        find myself with joy, especially when I'm in the snowy rocky mountains. Because of that, I
                        naturally gravitated towards Snowboarding üèÇ! This is why I chose to make snowboarding themed
                        Instagram account to learn about different content creation methods. This way it made it easier
                        for someone like me who doesn't use social media much.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Initial ideas of what your posts would be about. -->
                    <p>
                        So, I have chosen my Instagram accounts theme and had to come up with various unique post ideas.
                        There are so many ways to make Instagram posts, on all sorts of levels. You could
                        make very high-quality media files and post them to Instagram, which makes the overall account
                        more impactful in my opinion. Another solution is to purely make all your content via the mobile
                        device you're using, which is the way I did all the Instagram posts with some help for one post
                        utilizing Photoshop. Each post was thought about
                        and seen through, with my twist of what I was trying to accomplish.

                        Each post I did utilize my iPhone 12 and Ipad Pro (5th Gen.), and Photoshop was used
                        throughout this project. I used the Instagram app to make some custom posts, I also used another
                        app that helped format layouts with images, and the camera app on my Ipad to capture
                        high-quality
                        video.

                                    For this post, I wanted to share a cool tool that anyone can make at home. They only
                                    need to buy a 2 liter soda bottle and skateboard deck that is comfortable to use.
                                    All you need is to fill the bottle with water and roll the deck over the bottle,
                                    this is a make-shift balance board. Which helps you practice balance and its fun to
                                    play around with! I utalized my Ipad to capture a slow motion video and I edited it
                                    to my liking. This was from testing the video by watching what was being trimmed or
                                    not trimmed. I wrote the caption based off of what my audience might best get out of
                                    my post. So, I mention the DIY balance board.

                                    Here is a post that is pretty simple, but images can be pretty impactful alone. I
                                    took this photo on the mountain at the Brighton Resort in Utah. I just simply had to
                                    write a caption that just expressed my love for Brighton and the views you get
                                    their. I took a few pictures so I had a bunch to choose from, but I also had to
                                    decide if I wanted to doctor the image in any way possible. I added a black and
                                    white filter to the image, this was inspired by some snowboard photographers that
                                    used authentic cameras that shoot in black and white.

                                    with and I'm super proud of it. I utilized
                                    photoshop on my desktop and found images online to build a meme that is pretty
                                    common right now. The caption is just an upside-down face emoji because I'm pretty
                                    sure every single snowboarder knows exactly what this post is about. It took a bit
                                    to
                                    find the proper images for this, so I had to download a bunch and test them
                                    out--I just finally settled on the ones that you see above.

                    <!-- Conclusion. -->
                    <p>
                        I want to reiterate the fact that I'm not an active social media user, however, I do know how
                        impactful social media is. That is due to being working on this project and looking at other
                        Instagram accounts, I witnessed the type of immersive authoring that happens to engage with
                        audiences. I learned that there is a variety of ways to go about content creation for
                        Instagram specifically, and the limits I feel like are your creativity and access to tools for
                        creating digital media. For this project, I only utilized photoshop once and used my mobile
                        device with apps for every other post that I made. But I think if I used professional apps on my
                        desktop I could probably produce high-quality content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To sum up, my overall lesson of this project is that Immersive Authoring also envelopes what
                        content can be published to Instagram. I believe utilizing any tools you have access to help
                        with the production process will help, however, I recommend using any professional digital media
                        applications--like adobe applications.
