                    <!-- Why you chose your topic. -->
                    <p>
                        I'm a huge fan of snowboarding and mountain sports in general. Whenever I'm in the mountains I
                        find myself with joy, especially when I'm in the snowy rocky mountains. Because of that, I
                        naturally gravitated towards Snowboarding üèÇ! This is why I chose to make a snowboarding themed
                        instagram account to learn about different content creation methods. This way it made it easier
                        for someone like me who doesn't use social media much.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Initial ideas of what your posts would be about. -->
                    <p>
                        So, I have chosen my instagram accounts theme and had to come up with various post ideas that
                        were unique. There is so many ways to make instagram posts, on all sorts of levels. You could
                        make very high quality media files and post them to instagram, which makes the over all account
                        more impactful in my opinion. Another solution is to purely make all your content via the mobile
                        device you're using, which is the way I did all the instagram posts with some help for one post
                        utalizing Photoshop. Each post was thought about
                        and seen through, with my own twist of what I was trying to accomplish.

                        Each post I did utalizing my Iphone 12 and Ipad Pro (5th Gen.), and Photoshop was used
                        through out this project. I used the Instgram app to make some custom posts, I also used another
                        app the helped format layouts with images, and the camera app on my Ipad to capture high quality
                        video.

                    <!-- Conclusion. -->
                    <p>
                        I want to reiterate the fact that I'm not an active social media user, however I do know how
                        impactful social media is. That is due to me working on this project and looking at other
                        instagram accounts, I witnessed the type of immersive authoring that happens to engage with
                        audiences. I learned that there is a variety of ways to going about content creation for
                        Instagram specifically, and the limits I feel like are your creativity and access to tools for
                        creating digital media. For this project, I only utalized photoshop once and used my mobile
                        device with apps for every other post that I made. But I think if I used professional apps on my
                        desktop I could probably produced high quality content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To sum up my overall lesson of this project is that Immersive Authoring also envelopes what
                        content can be published to Instagram. I believe utalizing any tools you have access to help
                        with the production process will help, however I recommend using any professional digital media
                        applications--like adobe applications.
