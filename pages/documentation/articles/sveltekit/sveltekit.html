                        Svelte has become the JavaScript’s community most favored framework, according to the <a
                            class="svelteKit-Anchor"
                            href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/front-end-frameworks/"
                            target="_blank">State of
                            Javascript survey on Front-end Frameworks</a>. I want to be fully
                        transparent and say I’m new to frameworks but have an unwavering curiosity about how to utilize
                        these amazing tools. So, I conducted some personal research on frameworks and asked my peers
                        what they think about what I should use for web and app development. I found myself starting
                        with Svelte, specifically Sveltekit and my goal was to learn this framework by myself as much as
                        possible to eventually make API calls to the MarvelAPI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To provide context, I discovered the MarvelAPI in 2020 and it took me a full year to finally
                        figure out how to connect to this API without running into any issues. Because this API requires
                        the use of an API key that needs to be private and hidden client-side and I kept running into
                        CORS issues each time I did an API call with vanilla Javascript. I eventually learned that I had
                        to use Environment Variables and endpoints that I coded in JS and this code was only available
                        on the server! Essentially, these are the two key things I needed to finally achieve a
                        successful MarvelAPI call.

                <section class="SvelteKit-story">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> What is Sveltekit?</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the main factors why this framework is loved by the Javascript community is because
                        it enables a developer to build high-performance web apps. Sveltekit carries a lot of the
                        workload you would normally have to do with other frameworks. While Svelte itself is a
                        user-interface framework that is for vanilla Javascript (Svelte). But with Sveltekit, you get
                        the front-end and back-end capabilities that help you build a speedy web app.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a developer myself, I highly recommend studying and reading the documentation yourself <a
                            class="svelteKit-Anchor" href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction"
                            target="_blank">here</a>. It is a
                        skill that I have been
                        working on myself to
                        properly read the documentation. But for this article, I’ll highlight the two key things that
                        contributed to the success of my year-long endeavor: Environment Variables and Endpoints.
                    </p>

                <section class="SvelteKit-tools">
                    <div class="envs">
                        <a class="svelteKit-Anchor" href="https://kit.svelte.dev/faq#env-vars" target="_blank">
                            <h3>Enviornment Variables</h3>
                        </a>

                        <p>
                            Environment Variables are named values that impact how a script or a program will run. It is
                            essentially an assigned variable that is created and can be held on the back-end, via a
                            <i>.env</i>
                            file, or by inputting these values to where website-hosting services require them to run a
                            deployed web app. What is important about these is that you can store a variable—such as a
                            private API key—and it will be completely hidden client-side. In Sveltekit, it is running
                            <a class="svelteKit-Anchor" href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank">Vite</a> under the
                            hood and this
                            helps with running dev
                            servers and is
                            incredibly optimized for bundling Javascript code. I mention Vite because it also uses
                            <i>dotenv</i>, which is similar to <i>.env</i>. But, it helps how Sveltekit makes
                            environment
                            variables
                            available at runtime. To effectively use these, you must name your environmental variables
                            prefixed with <i>VITE_</i> and will look like this:
                        </p>
                        <i>
                            <p>VITE_MY_KEY: 123456780</p>
                        </i>
                    </div>
                    <div class="endpoints">
                        <a class="svelteKit-Anchor" href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#endpoints"
                            target="_blank">
                            <h3>Endpoints</h3>
                        </a>
                        <p>
                            Sveltekit could be defined as a speedy filesystem-based router, resulting in an
                            application that is defined by the structure of applications code (Svelte). All the routing
                            takes place in the directory called <i>src/routes</i> and this should be present when you
                            create a
                            new Sveltekit app. You can route two different things: pages that contain all the generated
                            HTML and endpoints that are created by the developer. You can create endpoints by adding a
                            new folder to the <i>routes</i> directory—named whatever you want—but this new folder will
                            contain
                            any Javascript or Typescript modules that export request handler functions (Svelte). All of
                            this is on the back-end and is hidden from the client and can be done with HTTP methods such
                            as <b>GET</b>, <b>POST</b>, <b>PUT</b>, <b>PATCH</b>, and <b>DELETE</b> (Svelte).

                    <p>
                        Sveltekit has enabled me as a web developer to build super-fast websites and has introduced me
                        to back-end processes. But, specifically, I needed the two key things that Sveltekit offered:
                        Environmental Variables and Endpoints. After just taking the time to read the documentation on
                        the framework, I learned how to make a secure API call that is happening completely on the
                        back-end. Allowing me to finally achive my goal to make a successful call from the MarvelAPI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far, my project with the MarvelAPI and Sveltekit is still ongoing. This is due to the
                        requirement of me learning my first javascript framework. However, I have noticed that it is
                        pretty easy to learn as a novice and I think this is a great introduction to frameworks because
                        of that. It helped me to learn how Svelte HTML files work, routing, JSX, installing/using
                        dependencies, environmental variables, and components.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I plan on making a website that will enable a Marvel fan to search for anything Marvel-related,
                        but mainly I want to make something that can help someone get into Comic Book reading. This is
                        all educational though and is meant to help me progress as a web developer. As I learn, I want
                        to help other developers who may be having the same trouble I had with making a successful API
                        call to the MarvelAPI, that is the purpose of this article. The two key things that helped me
                        achieve my goals are gaining the knowledge and ability to effectively use Environmental
                        Variables
                        and custom Endpoints—this helped me get past the unwanted CORS errors and to hide variables that
                        need to be hidden client-side.

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        To sum up, I’ve started to learn my first Javascript framework with the primary goals of finally
                        <i>getting</i> past those annoying CORS errors and <i>hiding</i> variables from the
                        user's web browser. To be
                        frank, I thought it was going to be difficult to achieve those goals. But with Sveltekit, it was
                        pretty easy to understand as a developer in learning, which is why I think that this framework
                        is the most loved in the community according to the State of Javascript Survey previously
                        mentioned in this article. Developers love it because the framework is fast, has front-end and
                        back-end capabilities, and is fairly simple to develop in as compared to other frameworks. I’ll
                        continue to update this article with my progress and my code will be available on my Github
                        repository for anyone to see and hopefully to help other developers like me that have that one
                        API they can’t make a successful API call to. As a final note, learning this framework “svelte”
                        was great.
