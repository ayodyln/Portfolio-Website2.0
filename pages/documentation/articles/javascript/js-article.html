                            Javascript is the best introductory web language to learn for beginner developers. The
                            reason being is that it's one of the three primary web languages and it gives you the
                            ability to not only learn important coding fundamentals but also enables a developer to
                            unleash their creativity via their fingertips running along with the keyboard. Albeit,
                            utilizing javascript to its fullest potential is not the easiest thing to do. Because there
                            is a lot to learn about javascript and in any javascript project you may not use everything
                            the web language can do. What is important to know is the fundamentals and how to read
                            documentation, then the rest is practice coding with javascript.

                        <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> What is Javascript?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Javascript can be described in three ways: <i>lightweight, interpreted, and just-in-time
                                compiled programing language</i> (<a
                                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" class="aJS">Javascript</a>). It is
                            one of the most popular web languages
                            learned and is used to build web applications or even native applications. It can be
                            utilized on the front end and the back end, making it popular for any type of developer. The
                            stuff you can do with javascript is a “the sky’s the limit” scenario because you can build
                            an application that could do anything you want. Anywhere from static websites to complex
                            video streaming services that can run on mobile smart devices, or you can build a website
                            about something you find cool with Javascript.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the cool stuff I’ve created with javascript is web browser-based applications. One
                            was a Pokemon Pokedex, which was built via doing <i>fetch</i> requests to the PokeAPI and
                            manipulating the DOM to display the content from the API database. Another was the Starwars
                            website, which was using local JSON data and array methods to display stuff like characters,
                            films, or starships. The one I want to use as an example for javascript is a Rick and Morty
                            website that helped me figure out how powerful javascript is. Below is a picture of the file
                            directory for the Rick and Morty website. Note that at this point a framework should be
                            utilized but this is a project I did purely to practice and learn javascript.

                        <p>
                            The methods I utilized to build this project were notably splitting up my javascript into
                            components that served specific purposes, then building the bridges between each by
                            exporting/importing javascript functions. But the other cool stuff I used to help display
                            and enable a user to manipulate the DOM, was with modern javascript methods/syntax too. Such
                            as the <a

                            These tools I just mentioned are probably going to be some of the most commonly used among
                            javascript developers, for myself I use these all the time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One of the best ways to request data from a database is via the Fetch API. When you use
                            fetch, it enables Javascript to interface with parts HTTP methods and has a method that can
                            be used in vanilla javascript <i>fetch()</i> (<a
                                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch" class="aJS">Fetch
                                API</a>). This method differs from the more dated
                            model of <i>jQuery.ajax()</i> by how a <i>promise</i> will behave and it is native vanilla
                            javascript, so
                            no need to work with jQuery. For the Rick and Morty project, I used <i>fetch</i> to get all
                            the
                            databases for the API and I also paired it with asynchronous calls to help with the heavy
                            <b>GET</b> request I was performing.

                        <p>
                            In the code snippet above, the function I have written is utilizing fetch and some other
                            things as well. Such as the <i>try…catch</i> block which helps execute code or immediately
                            output
                            an error if my fetch request doesn’t work right, I’m also converting the data into
                            Javascript Object Notation (JSON) to interact with the objects. This enables me later to
                            perform array methods and access object properties via <i>Dot Notation</i>. To me, this is
                            where
                            the cool stuff can happen because you have full access to data and get to create some cool
                            things.

                            Javascript has two data types: primitives and objects. Each is important to understand
                            because you’ll be working with these data types 24/7 with javascript. However, I want to
                            explain what objects and arrays are because they are key to how we interact with JSON data
                            being requested from an API database
                        </p>
                        <h3>Objects:</h3>
                        <p>
                            JSON is built out of objects and can have nested objects or arrays in a JSON file. Objects
                            allow for storing of strings, numbers, functions, and nested objects or arrays. This can be
                            pretty powerful with how we communicate data across <i>fetch</i> requests because we can
                            access any
                            property in an object with <i>Dot Notation</i>. See below for an example.
                        </p>
                        <div class="CodeWrapper">
                            <pre><code class="language-javascript jsTwo"></code></pre>
                        </div>
                        <h2>
                            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch" class="aJS">Arrays:</a>
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            These are essentially listed that store multiple items into one list and stored into a
                            variable. How arrays relate to objects is that arrays aren’t a primitive data type, but are
                            known as Array objects. Some key things to know about arrays can nest data types within
                            themselves, elements are accessed by index values, and arrays are zero-indexed. Which is a
                            stark contrast to how Objects are and function. However, at the end of the day, you’ll see
                            arrays within an object or vice versa, it is important to know to work with both. But what
                            is cool with arrays, is that you get array methods that are akin to object functions. These
                            methods help developers access and manipulate data from arrays: <i>forEach(), map(),
                                filter()</i>,
                            and there is so much more <a

                        <p>
                            There is a lot more to Javascript of course and it’s pretty hard to know everything about
                            the coding language. It is important to understand data types and how to work with them
                            because these data types are involved in everything javascript. Especially when we are
                            developing any web applications that need to grab data from outside sources like API
                            databases. In the Rick and Morty project I did, I had to <i>fetch</i> resources from their
                            database
                            to build out the website. For example, the characters page on my Rick and Morty website is
                            being displayed because I was able to <i>fetch</i> the characters from the API and convert
                            it into
                            JSON. The solution I came up with was to iterate through the arrays in the objects and use
                            the dot notion to grab specific information I wanted that was related to the characters

                            This article could’ve been much longer than what it currently is, that’s because there is so
                            much to javascript. Learning and using coding language is always a challenge because you
                            have to constantly be willing to learn and research solutions to the coding problems you’ll
                            run into. It isn’t about memorizing everything, that comes with practice and dedication.
                            What javascript is about, or at least how it is to me, is a language that enables someone to
                            create anything they want. You could create an application that helps track events for a
                            user or you could take it to an application that tracks space events that have occurred via
                            accessing the NASA API. It
                            can be super simple or complex, but that feeling of
                            creating something from scratch is an incredibly rewarding dopamine rush. This is why
                            javascript is the best language to learn as a beginner developer.
