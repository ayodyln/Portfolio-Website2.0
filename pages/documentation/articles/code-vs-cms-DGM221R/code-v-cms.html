                        What would you do if you knew one thing was better but had to do something else because it was
                        required? For myself, I was in a situation just like this that had me feeling like my back was
                        against the wall as a developer. During a project that I was a part of, I was the only developer
                        of three—the other two were great designers. So, it felt like a strong start because I felt like
                        my group members were creative and smart with anything on the design side. Enabling me as the
                        developer to focus only on my part, which was translating designs to a webpage. But I’m a
                        developer that is fairly efficient with coding and can produce prototypes or complete pages
                        quickly. But our client had a constraint that required me to use a Content Management System
                        (CMS) and this would be my first time even using one! So, this is a story all about how my
                        developer world got flipped-turned upside down.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section class="story">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> Coding vs. CMS</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the start of the project, there was no clear picture of what CMS I was going to use. To
                        admit, I would say this is my fault for not asking the necessary questions but there were also
                        issues with constant communication from our stakeholder (s). So, until a set CMS was picked, I
                        explored what was out there to prepare myself for this task to build a site only with a CMS.
                        There is a lot out there, but for this project, we ended up being limited to WordPress.
                        Admittedly I was not excited, I’ve heard nothing but horror stories about using WordPress to
                        build a website from the ground up. However, it was my task as part of this group, and I wanted
                        to learn as much as I can to be impactful. After learning the basics and learning that the
                        client wanted to have the ability to maintain/update their website after we hand it off to them,
                        I realized that there are valid use cases for a CMS, and it should be on be an available skill
                        in my toolset—just in case I had to work with a CMS again in the future.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Pros and Cons:</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a web developer, I was under the impression that coding a website from the ground up—rather
                        than a CMS—is the best way to do things. But as I just mentioned, I have learned that there are
                        valid use cases for a CMS. Probably the main valid point to use one is that maybe you don’t know
                        how to code a site but need one to build your business. But I want to point out the pros and
                        cons of building a site with a CMS or just coding it from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <h4>CMS</h4>
                    <p>
                        Content Management Systems are meant to make managing any website content easy for anyone in
                        need of a website. Anything from media, functional components and just text is designed to be
                        easily manageable by a CMS. Using WordPress as an example, which is one of the world's most
                        commonly used website builders. It enables the average person to build a website around a theme,
                        which is a template for a WordPress website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How I interpreted this was a theme was essentially a style guide for the site that is
                        automatically made for you. What the person making the site needs to do is just add the content,
                        make new pages, or essentially fill in the blanks. That is why I recognize this tool is an ideal
                        thing for someone who needs a website but doesn’t know how to code one or requires just a simple
                        way to have a site.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Coding</h4>
                    <p>
                        As a developer, I recognize I’ll have the bias to coding overusing a CMS. That is due to my
                        abilities with coding and how efficient I am with a coding workflow. I found out really quick in
                        building a site with WordPress that I was moving at a much slower pace. This is because I have
                        to now take the time to scan the WordPress Builders user interface and find what I need to
                        finish a task. That alone severely limited my overall impact and how fast I got milestones done
                        for the website. Not to mention that with code, my only limitations are my overall knowledge of
                        the web languages used and how creative I am with my code. Essentially, you’re making something
                        with your fingertips, and it is a rewarding feeling to make something this way.

                <section class="conslusion">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        The perspectives I just tried expressing may differ from others’ experiences or thoughts and
                        feelings towards CMSs in general. This is okay, but I wanted to detail the lessons I learned
                        from the experience in a recent project for developing a site in WordPress only. I was going
                        into it thinking this was going to be bad because of a pre-conceived notion CMS is a pain to
                        deal with. Because they aren’t the best things by far, they can be very clunky, crash, or just
                        confusing to navigate. But there are good reasons to use a CMS and as a developer, I should be
                        able to adapt to the constraints given to me by a client and give it my all to deliver a website
                        to them. To be honest, I will always prefer to code websites and that’s because I’m much more
                        effective and efficient in delivering a product this way. However, one hundred percent willing
                        to work with a client’s need for a CMS and to set them up for success in every way possible.
                        That willingness to adapt to absolute constraints is a crucial skill that has helped me mature
                        as a developer that works with collaborative groups and clients.
