                            Anyone who works in the Web Design and Development industry will certainly have to work in a
                            group to produce a product. Our industry is collaborative by nature, and we need to practice
                            the
                            skill of working with others! It is a skill because there are some things you have to learn
                            to be successful in collaboration. Such as the ability to communicate clearly with other
                            team
                            members. In this article, I’ll be outlining these key collaborative skills and the results
                            of
                            doing your part for the team.

                    <section class="story">
                        <p>
                            Currently, I’m a part of a group that is in the process of redesigning a website. This is a
                            very
                            unique challenge for me because I haven’t had too many chances to work in a group with my
                            peers.
                            At the time that I’m writing this, I’ve been a part of a few groups that were conducting
                            designs
                            or redesigns; however, this group is by far the most engaging group I’ve been in, and I’ve
                            learned a lot of skills that I think should be learned by anyone looking to join the
                            industry.
                            These skills include the ability to receive and give critiques to your peers, have clear
                            communication with the group, and share ideas with the team.
                        </p>

                        <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> Receiving/Giving Critiques</h2>
                        <p>
                            Any designer or developer should be able to give critique to their peers constructively and
                            respectfully. The relationship you form with your peers is key to maintaining and giving
                            critiques and is an important part of the collaborative process. Because how else can we
                            learn or improve from our mistakes, if we didn’t have another's point of view on our work?
                            Our team
                            can
                            constructively critique each other’s work. One time, during our project, I was presenting
                            wireframes to my group. They all listened to my ideas and in the end, they didn’t put me
                            down or
                            toss my ideas to the side. They said what they liked and suggested some other solutions to
                            try
                            or communicated clearly to me why something wasn’t working. The result was me learning an
                            important lesson about design principles and how others would incorporate a design principle
                            into their design. Not only can this produce stellar projects, but it helps promote a
                            learning
                            environment that I argue is important to a project’s success.

                        <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> Clear Communication</h2>
                        <p>
                            Another key component of working in groups effectively is having clear communication with
                            your
                            peers. Anything related to the project should be communicated to everyone in the group; this
                            will help avoid any confusion and roadblocks that might hinder the group. Design goals,
                            deadlines, group member whereabouts, and thoughts shouldn’t be lost in any confusion.
                            However,
                            when a group does experience confusion, it is key to recognize the current situation and get
                            everyone on the same page. This job should fall to whoever is the project lead, but for this
                            current group, I’ve been working with we don’t have a designated project lead. Rather, our
                            group
                            is composed of designers and developers that bring something to the table. In this
                            situation,
                            I’ve learned that clear communication is talking to each other in confidence about any
                            issues
                            that have popped up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, we had a task to create a set of mobile wireframes for our project. The task
                            was
                            fairly simple, but our group didn’t have clear enough communication on what certain
                            components
                            should look like. Components such as buttons, headers, and padding dimensions weren’t
                            properly
                            defined by the team. Resulting in our wireframes differing drastically, and to remedy this
                            we
                            had
                            to sit down again and revise our wireframes. This is a prime example of why communication is
                            paramount in groups, especially in groups that are tasked with creating a design for a
                            website
                            or
                            application. One of the prime design principles is <i>Continuity</i>, and because of the
                            lack
                            of
                            communication, we failed to design a product with continuity. It was an easy fix at the end
                            of
                            the day, but it was an issue that could’ve been easily avoided with clear communication.

                        <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> Sharing Ideas</h2>
                        <p>
                            Sharing or contributing ideas is a bit nerve-wracking to do, especially in the early phases
                            of a
                            group. For me, trying to muster up the courage to share an idea was difficult at first. If
                            you
                            are like me, my counsel to you is to remember that everyone is nervous to some degree to
                            share
                            ideas! It’s okay to share your ideas because every idea is an opportunity or option to
                            improve
                            the product your group is striving to create. One shouldn’t feel ashamed if their idea is
                            not
                            used in the end product, the whole process helps create better products. There are group
                            activities that you can do like a Creative Matrix or a Round Robin exercise, both of which
                            help
                            stimulate the group to produce ideas. There are many other group exercises you can conduct
                            to
                            get the ideas flowing, but what is key is to participate and do your part for the group.

                                    Currently, my group is still producing designs for the our client. But, I wanted to
                                    share a screen capture of Figma. This application is been the number one tool for us
                                    to share our ideas and iterate upon them. Which makes it our best collaborative
                                    space.

                            The three collaborative skills I mentioned are what I believe to be crucial skills to have.
                            To
                            be successful, each member should be able to demonstrate these skills. The team that i’ve
                            been working with to redesign a website, has taught me these important skills.
                            It has made the process rewarding not only for the client but also for ourselves as
                            designers
                            and developers.
