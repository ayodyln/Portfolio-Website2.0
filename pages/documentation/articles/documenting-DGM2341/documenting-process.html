                        The importance of knowing all the technology you’ll be using in a project is key, albeit you may
                        not be a master at everything, these fundamentals are still required for a designer and
                        developer to know what technology is going into their project and why/how it works. Then, you
                        also have to make sure you document your work and findings so that you can show them to your
                        peers or future potential clients. I’ll be using some documentation I created that talks about
                        codecs/formats and the technology behind them, it will serve as an example of what I think is
                        the big question. To document or not to document?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As designers or developers, it is key to understand how each piece of technology weaves together
                        to form a cohesive product. For example, a music streaming service would require a developer to
                        understand each single file format and how it will impact the user. While a designer should
                        still understand the fundamentals of these formats, they should be able to build a design around
                        what a user would expect when they’re using their product. So, what is one way to make sure
                        everyone is on the same page and understands the technology that they’re working with?
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section class="story">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> Document Everything!</h2>
                    <p>
                        Similar to the music streaming service example I provided, I had to research media formats of
                        all kinds for a project. I can talk about how an image format may look depending on the format
                        and compression setting being used, or I can explain how audio formats can impact a listener's
                        experience. I wasn’t researching all this for a product, but the purpose was to gain this
                        important knowledge of media formats and to learn how to properly document. You have to be able
                        to tell an informative story when you are documenting anything, and to be able to present
                        that story in a well-designed document.
                    </p>
                    <!-- INSERT IMAGE -->
                    <p>
                        There are a few key components to consider when you’re preparing to document something. You have
                        to
                        consider the goal of the document, the audience you’re reaching out to, and how you’ll structure
                        a well-designed story about what you’ve learned. All of these components—and some
                        practice—results in a document that is effective, informative, and can be beneficial for someone
                        else down the line. For this documentation I’m showcasing, I considered all those components and
                        it helped me structure my document.
                    </p>
                    <!-- INSERT IMAGE -->
                    <h3>Goal of the Document</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal of your document can vary, you could be trying to explain the importance of responsive
                        web design or how to properly implement logic into your JavaScript web application. For me, my
                        goal was to research the digital media output and find a way to communicate that with a
                        well-designed document. Before I started to communicate that though, I had to conduct research
                        that was related to my goal. Much of the research was conducted by reading documentation and
                        also by testing a variety of things. I did a full series of testing on image compression on the
                        most common formats used on the web.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Audience</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you start to craft your documentation, you have to figure out who or your audience is.
                        This is important because if you write something that is specifically crafted for an audience,
                        it could be more successful. For me, the example document I’m sharing was specifically to try to
                        be informative, but without too much jargon. However, this document is by nature technical. This
                        is fine because my audience consists of people in the digital media industry. But, if this was
                        for a client and explained the difference between media files, I would be wise with my wording
                        and find a way to make the document engaging. If you don’t consider your
                        audience, you could potentially have a document that communicates information poorly.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Document Structure</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you’re doing this kind of documentation, you have to consider how you’ll communicate any
                        information to the reader/audience. For this, we should look towards any design principles and
                        techniques that can help give the document some life and be more effective. Principles as simple
                        as chunking relevant information is incredibly important for communication, but also using
                        graphics that help paint a picture of what you want your reader to understand. Cool things to
                        try are to use graphics that help the reader know where to look, see Fig X. for an example. The
                        structure of the document is going to be the first thing the reader will notice and if it is too
                        much noise or doesn’t have the proper flow, it could lead to confusion and failure of
                        communicating to your audience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To sum up the importance of documenting and the components I’ve presented. I believe that any
                        designer or developer should document their work in a professional setting and research/personal
                        projects. In a professional setting, documentation enables a company to have internal resources
                        that can help the company in the long run. For research/personal projects, it’s great for you to
                        document the journey you’re on. Doing this is great because it can help build bridges and open
                        doors for you in the future, but we also live in a community of collaboration and the sharing of
                        knowledge could help the industry grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The document I used as an example in this document will be free and available to look at. Again,
                        it was for a research project about digital media formats and some other related topics. It may
                        be overwhelming, and there may be errors you see that I didn’t catch. But I want to share my
                        work and hopefully, someone else can look at it and get something out of it, either from the
                        inspiration of how to have good documentation or some type of knowledge about digital
                        media.
