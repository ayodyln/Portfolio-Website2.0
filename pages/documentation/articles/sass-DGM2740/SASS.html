                    <p>
                        Growing up you take things for granted. For example, I’ve never really given thought to how much
                        effort it takes to design and develop any web project or application. Part of that is because I
                        just haven’t studied anything to do with web and app development and I was the one using the
                        product not creating it. Now the lesson of how important it is to ensure your web project is
                        high-quality, if not perfect, across a multitude of devices is starting to set into my web
                        developer mind. But that goal of having a perfect website in terms of design, functionality, and
                        is compatible on any device is something anyone in the industry should shoot for, that drive
                        leads to pushing yourself always and finding a way to improve your skills.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section class="story">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> Quality Responsive Web Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        Quality websites only come about from hard work and skills learned from other projects and
                        studying. So as a student of web development I’m on a constant lookout for tools and resources
                        to develop quality web projects. For example, CSS is a key tool to style a website, but I’ve
                        learned about SASS/SCSS which has just helped increase my abilities to translate a design from
                        paper to a website, efficiently and effectively. There are other tools such as GhostLab, which
                        is software that spools up a local server to display your project (e.g., a static website)
                        across multiple devices at once—I’ll be working on an in-depth article about this software soon.
                        But I want to make SASS the main topic here because of how effective it is and how it sent me
                        down a path of pushing myself to learn more skills and to reach that goal of a fully responsive
                        website.
                    </p>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> SASS/SCSS</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I was introduced to SASS/SCSS, it flipped my world upside down! Not because it was another
                        obstacle in my path, but rather I saw the potential it had to help me as a developer. This was
                        another development tool that was going to help increase my overall effectiveness and efficiency
                        in developing/styling projects. Adding this tool to my arsenal has helped me feel like
                        delivering quality web projects is more attainable. So, what is SASS?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SASS is a preprocessor—or a style sheet language—that compiles your styling code into CSS.
                        Albeit you’re still essentially following the same syntax as you would with CSS. It’s also fair
                        to mention that if you’re using SASS, the syntax is a bit simpler. But I’d argue that using SCSS
                        is easier to understand since the syntax is the same as CSS—see fig below for an examples. When you
                        use SASS, it enables you to use partials, variables, nesting, functions, and much more. All of
                        which helps you have more organized code and arguably much more efficient as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the main things that I love about SASS is how well you can organize your code, unlike one
                        big CSS file. For example, you can look at a file of CSS that has as much as you want on it. But
                        the more you add to it, the more you need to scroll and work out a two-dimensional organizing
                        structure. However, with SASS, you can split your files apart as partials and import them into
                        one master SASS file. You can have files just for small, medium, and large devices or you can
                        have a file that is specifically for your variables (e.g., hex codes stored into variables) and
                        those variables can be called onto any of your files. See below, for an example of how this
                        master SASS file should look to accomplish this.
                    </p>

                    <!-- ! INSERT PRISM SASS SNIPPET -->
                    <pre>
                       <code class="language-sass"></code>
                   </pre>

                    <p>
                        I’ll have more examples of SCSS code below—which is what I prefer over using SASS—that is for
                        small, medium, and large devices. After starting to learn about SASS, I was sent down a rabbit
                        hole of testing my websites across a multitude of devices. Because of that exploration of how to
                        build a responsive website and the drive to improve my skills, I was able to evolve as a web/app
                        developer. I should admit that there were some growing pains and testing I had to do, such as
                        how to properly work with functions in SASS or little bugs like the preprocessor crashing in VS
                        Code. But I’m now confident in saying I can build a responsive website of high quality because
                        of how I utilize SASS.
                    </p>

                    <!-- ! INSERT PRISM SCSS SNIPPET -->
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-scss"></code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Another tool I was introduced to at the time and fueled my urge to properly test and make
                        responsive web designs is GhostLab. I want to make a full case study about this, and I will. But
                        for the sake of this article, it should be mentioned because SASS and Ghostlab worked together
                        to help me increase the overall quality of my projects. Earlier I mentioned that GhostLab is
                        software that helps display your code on a local server—which is just your computer. What is key
                        to understand is that it is serving up your code as it would if you had it uploaded to your
                        live website. Which makes it an ideal solution for anyone wanting to have a perfect responsive
                        website. Yes, you can use your developer tools from your web browser of choice. But the downside
                        is that this method isn’t always accurate when you’re trying to make anything accurate and
                        responsive. That’s why using GhostLab, which takes your code and runs it on a local server that
                        any device on the same network can access, is so important. It helps you ensure you have a
                        completely responsive website that any user can use from whatever device they’re using.

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Remember that goal I mentioned earlier about how any designer or developer should have this
                        mission to create high-quality, if not perfect, websites and apps? Well, I have that goal and I
                        know to reach that goal I need the tools and skills to do so. SASS is one of those tools that
                        has enabled me to flex my CSS skills and build a high-quality responsive website. Of course,
                        this still requires constant testing and checking for how your website works for any device. It
                        is a styling language that any developer should look into and see how it could positively affect
                        their projects. I also recommend reading my article about GhostLab to understand how to make
                        perfect responsive websites—it will be much more in-depth and a guide to how to make your device
                        testing workflow.
