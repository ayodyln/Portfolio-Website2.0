                    <p>
                        One of the most well-received video games in the past few years has finally been delivered to
                        the
                        world. This game is called <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring" class="zapAnchor"><i>Elden
                                Ring</i></a>, and it has taken the gaming community by storm. This is due to how the
                        world
                        is throw a person into a seemingly ever-expanding story. Some challenges test
                        the will of a person to beat an AI in a video game! The company that brought this game to the
                        world has also developed/produced <i>Dark Souls</i>, which is a notorious game that is
                        incredibly difficult and is not for the faint of heart. This is what I designed a pamphlet
                        about, with the purpose to help introduce the world to new players to this genre of the video
                        game.
                        To add a dash of immersive authoring of my own, I'll utilize some Zapworks tools to incorporate
                        some AR features.

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> What is Zapworks?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Zapworks is a tool that helps designers bring augmented reality (AR) to print via Zap Codes/QR
                        Codes. What this application offers is a set of tools that vary in intensity, such as simple QR
                        links that open a website or complicated AR components of images in a 3D space. These tools
                        enable someone to introduce some fun ways to story tell and bring a design to life in my
                        opinion.

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> The goal of the pamphlet</h2>
                    <p>
                        This new game has encapsulated my imagination, which is a feeling I haven't experienced since
                        playing <i>Halo (CE, 2, 3)</i>. It felt like I was in a world you would only be able to imagine
                        if you were reading a book! Which is a great sign of how this game has taken its story to the
                        next level along with how it enabled a player to interact with the video game's world. Because
                        of how stellar this game is and how well it immerses people, I wanted to make a pamphlet that
                        helped introduce people to the video game. To accomplish that, I used zapworks and came up with
                        these AR features to help add some creativity to the pamphlet:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="pGoal">
                        <li>Moving title image with the games menu theme music</li>
                        <li>Photo Album of in game content</li>
                        <li>Interactive World Map of the video game</li>
                        <li>Videos about the game</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-play"></i> How I used Zapworks</h2>
                    <p>
                        To incorporate Zapworks with my pamphlet, I utilized two tools of the four that are offered from
                        Zapworks: Designer (Beta) and Designer (Legacy). Both essentially serve the same purpose, but
                        the beta version of the tool is more akin to <i>Adobe Aero</i>. Each tool is functional with a
                        normal QR code or the Zapper code but offers slightly different experiences. The reason why I
                        used two versions of the Designer tool was of some limitations that Zapworks was presenting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the beta version of the tool, I was using some images I found and edited to fit within the
                        Zapworks image file constraints: JPEG or PNG and max 10 MB file size. However, the Zapworks web
                        app would freeze constantly upon upload of the anchor image, and processing of the image will
                        stall, ultimately the app will be in a frozen state. Because of this issue with uploading my
                        desired anchor image, I had to resort to the legacy version of the Designer tool.

                    <p>
                        The goal of completing the pamphlet was to learn how to incorporate AR into a print format,
                        which is a form of immersive authoring. That extra level of storytelling helps establish a fun
                        experience for a user. Since we have technology that helps bring the digital world to our
                        fingertips, such as AR from Zapworks. We can add not only some style to our work but helps
                        provide a
                        memorable experience to someone, resulting in the overall success of a product. The pamphlet I
                        came
                        up with I feel was a good way to bridge digital with print and make it about something I am
                        interested in. Albeit, the pamphlet I came up with is fairly simple. It still is a good example
                        of creating an immersive experience for a reader of a print pamphlet.
