                The goal of this project was to learn and explore the podcast
                creation process. Albeit my podcast isn't the best example of
                a podcast, I still learned the fundamentals of podcast
                creation and where podcasts came originally came from. Another
                goal was to understand what Immersive Authoring is and how it
                has an impact on someone.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to discover how to even talk into the
                microphone, whilst I was alone! This was by far the biggest
                obstacle I had to get past. Before I started this project, I
                had been contemplating how to speak into the microphone.
                Because I already have a fear of public speaking and I thought
                there would be a similar issue when I eventually started to
                create my podcast. To counteract this, I tried to pick a
                topic to make a podcast about that I truly enjoy and would
                feel a more comfortable rant about.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, the <span>Games & Lore Podcast</span> was created. I felt
                that talking about video games was a good fit and I knew I
                would've enjoyed the process because I felt more comfortable
                talking about something I love.

                The production process was easy in the terms of me already
                having the proper equipment to record a podcast. I had access
                to recording software, I opted for Garage Band though, and I
                also have the Elgato Wave:3 microphone for audio input. But
                since I utilized Garage Band, I was limited to using my iPad
                Pro (5th Gen) because I don't have any Mac computers--this was
                proven to not be an issue.
              </p>
              <div id="coverArtDiv">
                <p>
                  I also used my iPad for creating my Podcast cover art. I utilized mainly one app to accomplish this,
                  but
                  it
                  is fair to mention I used the Sketchbook app for the first sketch. I then utilized the Procreate app
                  and
                  just iterated upon my two favorite designs. It is not the best art, but because of the iPad I was able
                  to create this work and I'm still learning how to use the Apple Pencil to draw. Below you can see the
                  final drafts from the Procreate app.

                I started with understanding what Garage Band is and if
                I'm even able to use my microphone with the iPad. Once I had
                Garage Band downloaded, I started to practice with the
                software and was trying to understand how to just record crisp
                audio. Luckily, my microphone was compatible with my iPad and
                I was able to record what I was saying. Now all I had to do
                now was decide how I was wanting to produce my podcast.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started to tamper with a script and use that to provide
                structure to my podcast. However, once I had completed a draft
                I attempted to record a sample of my podcast and to see how
                the podcast flowed, which didn't flow well at all. I believe
                my issue was that I was reading the script word-for-word
                essentially and that resulted in me sounding like a mono-tone
                robot. So, I repurposed the script as a "guide" that helped me
                keep track of where I was and this proved to be more natural
                to me. I was able to rant from my thoughts and didn't feel
                like I was restricted to the script. So, I was now talking
                from my own will and it felt more free and comfortable to just
                talk and not give a speech that is following a script.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, now it was just up to me to record my podcasts episode,
                following a loose script and mainly relying on my
                solo-bantering about the topic of the episode. Admittedly,
                there were still complications throughout the process.
                There were points where I trailed off on a tangent or lost my
                train of thought and to fix that I had to re-record portions
                of the podcast.

                  <li>Play audio back and fix if need be</li>

                    Upload podcast to Anchor.fm and listened to the audio via
                    their website
                  </li>

              <div>
                <p>
                  I did testing this way to ensure that my audio wasn't a mess
                  and to make sure I was speaking too. Then I had to
                  account for all the extra music audio I was adding and make
                  sure my recorded audio wouldn't conflict with the music.
                  Ultimately, this helped create the intros and outros to add
                  character to the podcast and help captivate my audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All this testing was partly iterating upon my work as well.
                  Because each time a test failed it called for some type of
                  iteration to improve my work, for example, my audio recording
                  or my speech patterns required some form of iteration. I tried
                  different recording environments adjusted the gain on my
                  microphone, tried different music intros/outros, tried to
                  speak with more emotion rather than my usual monotone voice,
                  and tried different audio formats to make sure that my master
                  the file was at least amazing quality. After all that, I
                  eventually settled on my podcasts and worked on publishing my
                  final podcast drafts.

          <div>
            <p>
              To sum up, what I learned during this podcast project, I learned that immersive authoring is not an easy
              thing. It takes thought, time, and practice to make a quality experience for a consumer. Even though my
              podcast isn't the best and won't be hitting any top charts any time soon, it still helped me understand
              the podcast production process at a fundamental level. There are many other skills I think that are
              required
              too. For example, the ability to speak into the microphone for an extended period is a primary
              skill and was for sure my primary obstacle to overcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is there anything I could've or would do differently as I look back on this project? Yes there is a few
              things: better recording environment, used a desktop application for recording, and worked harder to
              obtain
              music that relates to the video game I was talking about.
            </p>
            <p>
              For my environment, it lacked in sound dampening
              and because of this, I had to mess with my noise suppression settings in Garage Band and it was
              troublesome
              to get it exactly right. For the desktop application, I feel I would've got my podcasts done a lot quicker
              if I just used my desktop instead of my iPad and that's just because I'm more efficient with my work on a
              desktop in general. Finally, the music issue, which was more of me having the conflict with figuring out
              how to obtain music from a video game legally and I opted not to do that because I didn't want to have
              copyright issues--also the Garage Band app wouldn't let me use the game music as a loop for recording,
              since it wasn't legally mine.
